# Plugin "libraries" for Circulation Manager

This is just a POC for running plugins in [Circulation Manager](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/circulation)
It add a new route `/libraries` in CM API that will return all libraries as JSON.
It add scripts to print libraries when the plugin is called in the backedn (`./bin/run_plugins`).
